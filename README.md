# New Twitch Android App UI with Flutter

Hi! Twitch recently updated their design over web and mobile. So, as an Flutter enthusiast, I tried to recreate Twitch Android app's UI (currently doesn't include player screen or settings screen, only home screen with few tabs) with Flutter. Since I don't have designer eyes, I didn't bother with fonts and font styles, so my copy doesn't exactly look the same with official app. I will try to improve it later.
